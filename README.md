# Welcome to my first published c++ project on github

This repository contains two *.cpp files
Both C.cpp and vector.cpp achieve the same objective of enabling users to input their students name/surname, along with their homework/exam grades, and subsequently calculate the final grade using either the average or median with a specific formula.:
Finalgrade = 0.4 * average/median + 0.6 * examGrade
vector.cpp uses vectors and C.cpp uses dynamic arrays
